# text-to-image-stable-diffusion
Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)
This project is a Text-to-Image Generation pipeline built using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Hugging Face’s 🤗 Diffusers library. It enables the creation of high-resolution, photorealistic images from natural language prompts.

Whether you're a developer, designer, or researcher, this project provides a simple yet powerful interface to explore the world of generative AI.

📌 Overview
Text-to-Image generation is one of the most exciting applications of generative models. By leveraging SDXL, one of the most advanced diffusion models from Stability AI, this repository demonstrates:

Prompt engineering for precise image generation.

Negative prompt filtering to avoid undesirable outputs.

GPU acceleration with PyTorch for faster inference.

A clean, modular codebase for easy customization.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Generate photorealistic images from text.
✅ Support for positive & negative prompts.
✅ Optimized for CUDA GPUs.
✅ Jupyter notebook included for interactive usage.
✅ Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

🖼️ Example Output
Prompt:

“A cinematic 35mm film still, highly detailed, photorealistic, of a stoic man standing still on a wet, reflective brick city sidewalk at night, wearing a dark, oversized blazer. Moody, dramatic streetlights illuminate him, creating sharp shadows and volumetric light.”

Negative Prompt:

“low quality, blurry, bad anatomy, distorted, noise”

Result:
